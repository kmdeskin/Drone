# Drone

This project stands out as one of my favorite hands-on projects, providing me with the opportunity to engage with a sophisticated embedded system and program it using C++. In the course of this ongoing project, I've successfully enabled the Tello drone to execute various functions, including taking off, performing a 360-degree spin, introducing time delays in seconds, and safely landing.
